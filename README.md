redmine2confluence-wiki
=======================

Set of scripts to import data from redmine wiki to Confluence
Based on:
- Tim Jansen's gist https://gist.github.com/tim-jansen/6263586 
- Stefan BÃ¼hler's redmine export script: http://stbuehler.de/blog/article/2011/06/04/exporting_redmine_wiki_pages.html

Usage:
----------
To use this conversion:
- Execute ExportWiki.export_all from exportwiki.rb in the redmine environment. This will create set of folders with all the project data
- Edit redmine_spaces.py file to 
	* provide reference to Jira ticket link conversion or another ticketing system (it will replace \g<1> with original redmine ID)
	* configure mapping of redmine projects to confluence spaces. Different projects can be mapped to the same space. in this case conflicting pages will be ignored
- Modify 'import_confluence.py' to configure:
	* user name
	* password
	* confluence URL
- Run the python script 'import_confluence.py' in the exported data folder (root level)
